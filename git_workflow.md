1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the Git workflow?
I'm moderately confident that I understand things. I'm confident in my understanding of git commands, except cloning. 

2. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that?
I need to practice forking and cloning, I often forget wht to type before pasting the SSH message. 

3. What part of the Git Workflow is still confusing for you?
I'm confused what is meant by adding tasks in exercise 1, and also for #12 adding changes, when no changes were made?
